# init

The following code chunks checks if each package is installed and installs it if not.
It installs the version of the package that the code was tested and used on, however, the version numbers should not matter much.
It then loads the installed package

```{r}
# Ensure the remotes package is installed for version-specific installs
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

# List of required packages with versions
required_packages <- list(
  tidyverse = "2.0.0",
  magrittr = "2.0.3",
  data.table = "1.14.8",
  purrr = "1.0.1",
  scales = "1.2.1",
  patchwork = "1.1.2",
  psych = "2.4.3"
)

# Function to check if a package is installed and is the correct version
is_installed <- function(pkg, version) {
  installed <- is.element(pkg, installed.packages()[, "Package"])
  if (installed) {
    installed_version <- as.character(packageVersion(pkg))
    return(installed_version == version)
  }
  return(FALSE)
}

# Install any packages that are not yet installed or not the specified version
for (pkg in names(required_packages)) {
  if (!is_installed(pkg, required_packages[[pkg]])) {
    remotes::install_version(pkg, version = required_packages[[pkg]], repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
  }
}

# Load all required packages
lapply(names(required_packages), library, character.only = TRUE)

```
